FACET is an open source library for human-explainable AI.
It combines sophisticated model inspection and model-based simulation to enable better 
explanations of your supervised machine learning models.

FACET is composed of the following key components:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |spacer|        | **Model Inspection**                                                  |
|                 |                                                                       |
| |inspect|       | FACET introduces a new algorithm to quantify dependencies and         |
|                 | interactions between features in ML models.                           |
|                 | This new tool for human-explainable AI adds a new, global             |
|                 | perspective to the observation-level explanations provided by the     |
|                 | popular `SHAP <https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ approach.   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |spacer|        | **Model Simulation**                                                  |
|                 |                                                                       |
| |sim|           | FACETâ€™s model simulation algorithms use ML models for                 |
|                 | *virtual experiments* to help identify scenarios that optimise        |
|                 | predicted outcomes.                                                   |
|                 | To quantify the uncertainty in simulations, FACET utilises a range    |
|                 | of bootstrapping algorithms including stationary and stratified       |
|                 | bootstraps.                                                           |

|                 |                                                                       |
| |pipe|          | FACET offers an efficient and transparent machine learning            |
|                 | workflow, enhancing                                                   |
|                 | `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`__'s       |
|                 | tried and tested pipelining paradigm with new capabilities for model  |
|                 | selection, inspection, and simulation.                                |
|                 | FACET also introduces                                                 |
|                 | `sklearndf <https://github.com/BCG-Gamma/sklearndf>`__                |

Acknowledgements
----------------

FACET is built on top of two popular packages for Machine Learning:

-   The `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`__ learners and
    pipelining make up implementation of the underlying algorithms. Moreover, we tried
    to design the FACET API to align with the scikit-learn API.
-   The `SHAP <https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ implementation is used to
    estimate the shapley vectors which FACET then decomposes into synergy, redundancy,
    and independence vectors.
