science toolbox!

Introductory Tutorial: Incident risk of drilling operations
*****************************************************************************

Introduce yourself to the FACET workflow! With this tutorial you will:

- develop a classifier for predicting incident risk of drilling operations using
  drilling sensor data, and
- use model inspection and simulation to understand what drilling operation parameters
  impact incident risk, with a particular focus on rate of penetration.

Regression Tutorial: Predictive Maintenance
************************************************

Learn regression the FACET way with this tutorial investigating the performance of a
naval vessel Gas Turbine propulsion plant. In this tutorial you will:

- build a model to accurately predict the decay state of the gas turbine, and
- gain insight into parameters that drive the decay state and how they interact with
  each other and performance decay.

Understanding synergy and redundancy with synthetic data
*************************************************************

Improve your intuition for FACET's advanced model inspection with this tutorial.
In this tutorial you will:

- understand how synergy and redundancy for a feature pair varies with interaction and
  correlation, and,
- explore how over-fitting affects the accuracy of redundancy and synergy estimates.
