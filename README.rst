*facet* is an open source library for human-explainable AI.
It combines sophisticated model inspection and model-based simulation to enable better 
explanations of your supervised machine learning models.

*facet* is composed of the following key components:

+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |inspect|      | **Model Inspection**                                                |
|                |                                                                     |
|                | *facet* introduces a new algorithm to quantify dependencies and     |
|                | interactions between features in ML models.                         |
|                | This new tool for human-explainable AI adds a new, global           |
|                | perspective to the observation-level explanations provided by the   |
|                | popular `SHAP <https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ approach.  |
|                | To learn more about *facet*’s model inspection capabilities, see the|
|                | getting started example below.                                      |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| |sim|          | **Model Simulation**                                                |
|                |                                                                     |
|                | *facet*’s model simulation algorithms use ML models for             |
|                | *virtual experiments* to help identify scenarios that optimise      |
|                | predicted outcomes.                                                 |
|                | To quantify the uncertainty in simulations, *facet* utilises a range|
|                | of bootstrapping algorithms including stationary and stratified     |
|                | bootstraps.                                                         |
|                | For an example of *facet*’s bootstrap simulations, see the getting  |
|                | started example below.                                              |

Quickstart
----------------------

The following quickstart guide provides a minimal example workflow to get up and running
with *facet*.

Enhanced Machine Learning Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: Python

    # standard imports
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold

    # some helpful imports from sklearndf
    from sklearndf.pipeline import RegressorPipelineDF
    from sklearndf.regression import RandomForestRegressorDF

    # relevant FACET imports
    from facet.data import Sample
    from facet.selection import LearnerRanker, LearnerGrid

    # load Boston housing dataset
    boston = load_boston()
    boston_df = pd.DataFrame(data=boston.data, columns=boston.feature_names).assign(
        MEDIAN_HOUSE_PRICE=boston.target
    )

    # create FACET sample object
    boston_sample = Sample(observations=boston_df, target_name="MEDIAN_HOUSE_PRICE")

    # create a (trivial) pipeline for a random forest regressor
    rnd_forest_reg = RegressorPipelineDF(
        regressor=RandomForestRegressorDF(random_state=42)
    )

    # define grid of models which are "competing" against each other
    rnd_forest_grid = [
        LearnerGrid(
            pipeline=rnd_forest_reg,
            learner_parameters={
                "min_samples_leaf": [8, 11, 15]
            }
        ),
    ]

    # create repeated k-fold CV iterator
    rkf_cv = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=42)

    # rank your models by performance (default is variance explained)
    ranker = LearnerRanker(
        grids=rnd_forest_grid, cv=rkf_cv, n_jobs=-3
    ).fit(sample=boston_sample)

    # get summary report
    ranker.summary_report()

Model Inspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*facet* implements several model inspection methods for
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html>`_ estimators.
Fundamentally, facet enables post-hoc model inspection by breaking down the interaction
effects of the features used for model training:

- **Redundancy**
  represents how much information is shared between two features' contributions to
  the model predictions. For example, temperature and pressure in a pressure cooker are
  redundant features for predicting cooking time since pressure will rise relative to
  the temperature, and vice versa. Therefore, knowing just one of either temperature or
  pressure will likely enable the same predictive accuracy. Redundancy is expressed as
  a percentage ranging from 0% (full uniqueness) to 100% (full redundancy).

- **Synergy**
  represents how much the combined information of two features contributes to
  the model predictions. For example, given features X and Y as
  coordinates on a chess board, the colour of a square can only be predicted when
  considering X and Y in combination. Synergy is expressed as a
  percentage ranging from 0% (full autonomy) to 100% (full synergy).


.. code-block:: Python

    # fit the model inspector
    from facet.inspection import LearnerInspector
    inspector = LearnerInspector()
    inspector.fit(crossfit=ranker.best_model_crossfit_)

    # visualise redundancy as a matrix
    from pytools.viz.matrix import MatrixDrawer
    redundancy_matrix = inspector.feature_redundancy_matrix()
    MatrixDrawer(style="matplot%").draw(redundancy_matrix, title="Redundancy Matrix")

.. image:: _static/redundancy_matrix.png
    :width: 600

We can also better visualize redundancy as a dendrogram so we can identify clusters of
features with redundancy.

.. code-block:: Python

    # visualise redundancy using a dendrogram
    from pytools.viz.dendrogram import DendrogramDrawer
    redundancy = inspector.feature_redundancy_linkage()
    DendrogramDrawer().draw(data=redundancy, title="Redundancy Dendrogram")

.. image:: _static/redundancy_dendrogram.png
    :width: 600

For feature synergy, we can get a similar picture

.. code-block:: Python

    # visualise synergy as a matrix
    synergy_matrix = inspector.feature_synergy_matrix()
    MatrixDrawer(style="matplot%").draw(synergy_matrix, title="Synergy Matrix")

.. image:: _static/synergy_matrix.png
    :width: 600

Please see the :ref:`API reference` for more detail.

Model Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: Python

    # FACET imports
    from facet.validation import BootstrapCV
    from facet.crossfit import LearnerCrossfit
    from facet.simulation import UnivariateUpliftSimulator
    from facet.simulation.partition import ContinuousRangePartitioner
    from facet.simulation.viz import SimulationDrawer

    # create bootstrap CV iterator
    bscv = BootstrapCV(n_splits=1000, random_state=42)

    # create a bootstrap CV crossfit for simulation using best model
    boot_crossfit = LearnerCrossfit(
        pipeline=ranker.best_model_,
        cv=bscv,
        n_jobs=-3,
        verbose=False,
    ).fit(sample=boston_obs)

    SIM_FEAT = "LSTAT"
    simulator = UnivariateUpliftSimulator(crossfit=boot_crossfit, n_jobs=3)

    # split the simulation range into equal sized partitions
    partitioner = ContinuousRangePartitioner()

    # run the simulation
    simulation = simulator.simulate_feature(feature_name=SIM_FEAT, partitioner=partitioner)

    # visualise results
    SimulationDrawer().draw(data=simulation, title=SIM_FEAT)

Acknowledgements
---------------------------

*facet* is built on top of two popular packages for Machine Learning:

The `scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`_ learners and
pipelining make up implementation of the underlying algorithms. Moreover, we tried
to design the facet API to align with the scikit-learn API.

The `shap <https://github.com/slundberg/shap>`_ implementation is used to estimate the
shapley vectors which *facet* then decomposes into synergy, redundancy, and independence
vectors.

:ref:`about_us` page.

We are always on the lookout for passionate and talented data scientists to join the
